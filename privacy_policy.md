Provider will make a good faith effort to ensure that such overseas recipients deal with Personal Information in a way that is consistent with the principles in the Privacy Act

## Privacy questions contact

There needs to be a way for Individuals to get in touch with the Provider about privacy issues (including complaints).  For small organisations, it's probably easiest to just use your routine public contact details to file complaints about privacy.

Larger organisations may wish to nominate a privacy officer to deal with privacy related complaints. A privacy officer is an individual within your organisation that is responsible for dealing with privacy issues.

### Privacy complaints and questions go to the Provider's general contact details.

Customer questions or complaints relating to Provider's dealings with Personal Information should be directed to Provider on {{contact details}}.

Provider will make a reasonable effort to resolve Customer complaints or questions, and where Provider is unable to do so, Provider will attempt to explain why it is unable to do so.

### Privacy complaints and questions go to the Provider's privacy officer.

Customer questions or complaints relating to Provider's use of Personal Information should be directed to Provider's privacy officer. Provider's privacy officer is {{privacy officer}}, contactable on {{contact details}}.

Provider's privacy officer will make a reasonable effort to address Customer complaints or questions, and where the privacy officer is unable to do so, the privacy officer will attempt to explain why it is unable to do so.

## Unknowingly collected information

It's possible that Provider ends up collecting certain Personal Information without being aware of it. For example, if your organisation is a data backup service, Organisations may use the Service to back up the information of Individuals that the Organisation collects at first instance.

It's a good idea to explain to people that you're aware of the possibility, and are making a good faith effort to handle it.

### Personal Information that Provider collects unknowingly.

Provider acknowledges that from time to time, Provider may come into possession of Personal Information without being aware of it, for example, other organisations using Provider's service to store data.

Provider will make a good faith effort to deal with such Personal Information in accordance with this privacy policy and the principles in the Privacy Act.

## Using the Providers services to disclose Personal Information to other organisations

In practice, while using your services, customers might disclose their Personal Information to other organisations. For example, sharing their credit card details with a payment processor. This clause makes it clear that this might happen, and that how other organisations deal with Personal Information is ultimately up to them.

### Using the Providers services to disclose Personal Information to other organisations

From time to time, during the routine use of Provider's services, Customer's may disclose Personal Information to other organisations. While Provider will make a good faith effort to ensure that such disclosure to other organisations is clear to Customer, how other organisations handle Personal Information is ultimately beyond the control of Provider.
