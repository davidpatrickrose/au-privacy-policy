# Software Development Agreement

`Purpose` This a template for creating privacy policies for Australian organisations.

`Party 1 Name` Contractor

`Party 2 Name` Customer

`Jurisdiction` Australia

## Preamble

Insert some polite garbage about respecting the privacy of your customers here.

### Preamble

This document is intended to be interpreted under the [lawpatch interpretation principles](lawpatch.org), a set of commincation conventions designed to make documents with legal significance easier to understand.


{{Polite garbage}}

PATXXX : Allens seems to imply (but not does not state) that certain organisations are required to explicitly state that they are bound by the principles in the Privacy Act. Is anyone required to explicitly state that they are bound by the Principles in the Privacy act? If not we should delete this entirely. Not worth keeping just for the polite garbage.


## Changes to the Agreement

You probably want to be able to change your privacy policy merely by notifying people via email.

PATXXX: Additional optional clause for using PI for direct marketing since it's legislatively complicated? (both Privacy Act and SPAM act)

Or just state in template purpose that this isn't a suitable privacy policy if you use _lots_ of direct marketing? Since we already hit our 90%?

You should let people know who else you're sharing their personal information with. Disclosure includes stuff like storing personal information in the cloud, or sharing phone numbers with an outsourced call centre.

XXX: Optional inclusion widget for all this.

PATXXX: Does this text meet the informed consent exception in APP 8?

Contractor may disclose personal information to organisations outside of Australia such as, {{overseas PI disclosure}} located in {{other countries}}


XXX: In terms of handling this as a widget, maybe a table of disclosures and countries?

- cloud service providors
- payment processors
- anything else? the entire above list?

Contractor will make a good faith effort to ensure that such overseas recipients deal with Personal Information in a way that is consistent with the principles in the Privacy Act


## Contacting Contractor about privacy issues

It's a good idea to have a way for customers to complain or ask questions about your use of personal information. It shows customers that there's probably an easier way to resolve problems than leaping straight to the courts.

For small organisations, it's probably easiest to just use your routine public contact details to file complaints about privacy.

Larger organisations may wish to nominate a privacy officer to deal with privacy related complaints. A privacy officer is just some reasonably high ranking individual within your organisation that is responsible for addressing and managing privacy issues. It doesn't have to be a full time job. 

### Complaints and questions about privacy go to general contact details

Customer questions or complaints relating to Contractor's use of Personal Information should be directed to Contractor on {{contact details}}. Contractor will make a reasonable effort to resolve Customer complaints or questions, and where Contractor is unable to do so, Contractor will attempt to explain why it is unable to do so.

### Complaints and questions about privacy go to privacy officer

Customer questions or complaints relating to Contractor's use of Personal Information should be directed to Contractor's privacy officer. Contractor's privacy officer will make a reasonable effort to address Customer complaints or questions, and where the privacy officer is unable to do so, the privacy officer will attempts to explain why it is unable to do so.

Contractor's privacy officer is {{privacy officer}}, contactable on {{contact details}}

## Personal Information that Contractor is not aware it possesses

It's entirely possible that your organisation may end up being in possession of Personal Information without being aware of it. For example, if your organisation is a data backup service, your customers may use your service to back up their client information. Under the Privacy Act, you would be in possesion of this Personal Information, even though you don't examine the backups you store for people.

Dealing with a situation like this perfectly is very difficult, but it's a good idea to explain to people that you're at least aware of the possibility, and are making a good faith effort to handle it.

### Personal Information that Contractor is unaware it possesses

Contractor acknowledges that from time to time, Contractor may come into possession of Personal Information without being aware of it, for example, other organisations using Contractor's service to store data. Contractor will make a good faith effort to deal with such Personal Information in accordance with this privacy policy and the principles in the Privacy Act.

## Using the Contractors services to disclose Personal Information to other organisations

In practice, while using your services, customers might disclose their Personal Information to other organisations. For example, sharing their credit card details with a payment processor. This clause makes it clear that this might happen, and that how other organisations deal with Personal Information is ultimately up to them.

### Using the contractors services to disclose Personal Information to other organisations

From time to time, during the routine use of Contractor's services, Customer's may disclose Personal Information to other organisations. While Contractor will make a good faith effort to ensure that such disclosure to other organisations is clear to Customer, how other organisations handle Personal Information is ultimately beyond the control of Contractor.
