{{information disclosure}}

## Disclosing information outside Australia

Provider may disclose personal information to organisations outside of Australia such as, {{overseas organisations}} located in {{countries disclosed to}}.

Provider will make a good faith effort to ensure that such overseas recipients deal with Personal Information in a way that is consistent with the principles in the Privacy Act

## Privacy questions contact

It's a good idea to have a way for customers to complain or ask questions about your use of personal information. It shows customers that there's probably an easier way to resolve problems than leaping straight to the courts.

For small organisations, it's probably easiest to just use your routine public contact details to file complaints about privacy.

Larger organisations may wish to nominate a privacy officer to deal with privacy related complaints. A privacy officer is just some reasonably high ranking individual within your organisation that is responsible for addressing and managing privacy issues. It doesn't have to be a full time job.

### Complaints and questions about privacy go to general contact details

Customer questions or complaints relating to Provider's use of Personal Information should be directed to Provider on {{contact details}}. Provider will make a reasonable effort to resolve Customer complaints or questions, and where Provider is unable to do so, Provider will attempt to explain why it is unable to do so.

### Complaints and questions about privacy go to privacy officer

Customer questions or complaints relating to Provider's use of Personal Information should be directed to Provider's privacy officer. Provider's privacy officer will make a reasonable effort to address Customer complaints or questions, and where the privacy officer is unable to do so, the privacy officer will attempts to explain why it is unable to do so.

Provider's privacy officer is {{privacy officer}}, contactable on {{contact details}}

## Personal Information that Provider is not aware it possesses

It's entirely possible that your organisation may end up being in possession of Personal Information without being aware of it. For example, if your organisation is a data backup service, your customers may use your service to back up their client information. Under the Privacy Act, you would be in possesion of this Personal Information, even though you don't examine the backups you store for people.

Dealing with a situation like this perfectly is very difficult, but it's a good idea to explain to people that you're at least aware of the possibility, and are making a good faith effort to handle it.

### Personal Information that Provider is unaware it possesses

Provider acknowledges that from time to time, Provider may come into possession of Personal Information without being aware of it, for example, other organisations using Provider's service to store data. Provider will make a good faith effort to deal with such Personal Information in accordance with this privacy policy and the principles in the Privacy Act.

## Using the Providers services to disclose Personal Information to other organisations

In practice, while using your services, customers might disclose their Personal Information to other organisations. For example, sharing their credit card details with a payment processor. This clause makes it clear that this might happen, and that how other organisations deal with Personal Information is ultimately up to them.

### Using the Providers services to disclose Personal Information to other organisations

From time to time, during the routine use of Provider's services, Customer's may disclose Personal Information to other organisations. While Provider will make a good faith effort to ensure that such disclosure to other organisations is clear to Customer, how other organisations handle Personal Information is ultimately beyond the control of Provider.
